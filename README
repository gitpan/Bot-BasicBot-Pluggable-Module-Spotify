Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-Spotify

This is a plugin for a Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable bot.
Whenever someone writes a Spotify URI in an IRC channel, the plugin
does a lookup for that URI, using the Spotify Metadata API through
Net::Spotify, and sends back in the channel a message with the
relevant information.

Have fun! :)
